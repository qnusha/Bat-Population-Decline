# Bat-Population-Decline
## MIT Break Through Tech AI
Our goal is to predict the presence of White-Nose Syndrome (WNS) in bat populations using machine learning techniques. It integrates data from three bat population datasets, which include geolocation, acoustic, and timestamp data, and focuses on building predictive models to analyze the bat population decline in North America.


Two different approaches are explored:

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Model:** A text-based neural network model built using bat population data, with a focus on feature engineering and tokenization techniques, achieving an accuracy of 87%.
2. **Random Forest Model:** A non-NLP model that uses classical machine learning techniques, reaching a 97% accuracy rate in predicting WNS presence.
